# Node.js Social Hour
## Code Challenge: August 18th, 2016

### Requesting Github Repository Issues

- [API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- [React repo issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues)
- Time Limit: 1 hour

#### Level 1
We will be splitting into groups with the goal of scripting an API request to pull a list of issues from the Facebook React repository.

__You do not need your Github user credentials. Please don't expose those to the group.__

__Do not include pull requests__


#### Level 2
The API limits how many issues are returned. Use the API's paging feature to pull all open issues for the repository, not including pull requests.


#### Nightmare Level
Pull issues from a private repository. You will need to be authenticated in order to do this. There are a couple ways to do this, the trickiest is OAuth. You will need admin repository privileges. I would recommend creating a personal private repository and adding issues for this challenge, _this way you do not expose private information._


### Done
Depending on time we will either stop after level 1 or 2 and have each group show their solution and talk through the choices made.
